# Deny blast-radius preview (`internal/denysim`)

Review-only answer to: *if I added this emergency deny and flipped enforce, which observed counters would it have matched?*

This is not the multi-hop dependency walk in [`docs/blast-radius.md`](blast-radius.md) and not the CiliumNetworkPolicy review in `insights.PolicyBlastRadius`. It scores a **proposed eBPF deny** against the latest non-stale `AgentReport` aggregates.

## Use it

```bash
netractl ebpf deny-preview cidr 203.0.113.0/24 egress
netractl ebpf deny-preview ip 1.1.1.1 both --protocol UDP --port 53
netractl ebpf deny-preview dns evil.example
netractl ebpf deny-preview sni cdn.example --namespace prod
netractl ebpf deny-preview process curl
netractl ebpf deny-preview port 445 --protocol TCP
```

`POST /api/v1/ebpf/deny/preview`

```json
{
  "kind": "cidr",
  "value": "203.0.113.0/24",
  "direction": "egress",
  "protocol": "TCP",
  "namespace": "prod",
  "limit": 50
}
```

`kind` is one of `ip`, `cidr`, `port`, `dns`, `sni`, `process`. `direction` defaults to `both`. The handler writes nothing to the store, records no audit event, and does not change observe/enforce.

MCP tool: `netra_ebpf_deny_preview` (read-only; available even when `NETRA_MCP_ALLOW_MUTATIONS` is off).

## Evidence boundaries

- Hits are **cumulative counters from the current agent snapshot**, not a historical per-flow store. `internal/counterfactual` remains unwired for the same reason documented in that package: Netra does not retain queryable individual flows.
- A miss means Netra did not observe matching traffic in this window. It does not mean the destination is unused, or that enforce would be a no-op.
- `process` matching uses sampled `FastPathEvent` rows and `comm` only — not a cryptographic workload identity.
- Stale agents are counted and skipped.
- `truncated: true` means more groups existed than `limit` (default 50, max 200). Totals still include the truncated groups.
- Every response carries `denysim.Caveat`. Do not render hits as "would be blocked in production" without that sentence.

## Validation

`internal/denysim/denysim_test.go` covers CIDR matching with stale-agent skip, exact IP + port filters, DNS/SNI name match (case-insensitive), sampled process events, and rejected unknown kinds.

No kernel/BPF component — standard `go test ./internal/denysim ./internal/api` is sufficient.
