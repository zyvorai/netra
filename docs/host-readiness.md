# Netra host readiness (`netra-doctor`)

`netra-doctor` is a read-only preflight command for Netra's standalone eBPF node agent. It helps operators determine whether a Linux host has the kernel, cgroup, bpffs, tracepoint and privilege prerequisites Netra expects **before** deploying the privileged agent.

It never mounts filesystems, changes sysctls, loads BPF programs, attaches hooks, or mutates network state.

## Build

```bash
go build ./cmd/netra-doctor
```

## Basic check

```bash
sudo ./netra-doctor
```

The command exits with code `0` when no required check fails and `2` when one or more checks fail.

Warnings are advisory by default. For CI or provisioning gates, make warnings fatal:

```bash
sudo ./netra-doctor --strict
```

## Optional feature gates

Netra's default standalone path is cgroup v2. TCX and kernel skb drop-reason tracing are optional. If a deployment intends to use them, require them explicitly:

```bash
sudo ./netra-doctor --require-tcx --require-drop-reasons
```

`--require-tcx` requires Netra's practical Linux `6.6+` TCX baseline.

`--require-drop-reasons` requires an `skb:kfree_skb` tracepoint whose format exposes a `reason` field. This matches Netra's observe-only v0.14 drop diagnostics guard: hosts that cannot prove the field exists should not report fabricated kernel drop reasons.

## JSON output

```bash
sudo ./netra-doctor --json
```

Example shape:

```json
{
  "os": "linux",
  "architecture": "arm64",
  "kernelRelease": "6.8.0",
  "checks": [
    {
      "id": "cgroup-v2",
      "title": "cgroup v2",
      "status": "pass",
      "detail": "5 controllers visible"
    }
  ],
  "summary": {
    "pass": 12,
    "warn": 2,
    "fail": 0,
    "info": 1
  }
}
```

The JSON format is suitable for image-build validation, Ansible/Terraform wrappers, Kubernetes node admission workflows, and support bundles.

## Checks

The first release validates:

- Linux and architecture (`amd64`/`arm64` are the normal targets);
- Linux `5.8+` core baseline and optional `6.6+` TCX baseline;
- cgroup v2 controller and unified membership visibility;
- bpffs mounted at `/sys/fs/bpf`;
- kernel BTF availability;
- tracefs availability;
- optional `skb:kfree_skb` drop-reason field support;
- effective BPF/network-related Linux capabilities;
- `kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled` posture;
- kernel lockdown mode;
- live-host `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK`;
- UP non-loopback interfaces that may be candidates for optional TCX/XDP attachment.

## Inspecting a mounted support bundle

Most filesystem checks can run against a different root:

```bash
./netra-doctor --root /mnt/support/node-17 --json
```

When `--root` is not `/`, checks that require the running process rather than filesystem evidence (currently memlock and live interface enumeration) are reported as `info`/skipped instead of producing misleading results.

## Safety boundary

A successful doctor report means the visible host prerequisites look compatible. It is **not** proof that every BPF program will attach: vendor kernels, LSM policy, container runtime restrictions, interface/driver XDP capabilities, and local security policy can still reject an operation. Netra should continue to fail open and report hook-level attachment state at runtime.
