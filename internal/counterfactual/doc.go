// Package counterfactual evaluates a network policy against observed flow
// history and returns what the policy would have denied, what it would
// have broken, and when the affected patterns first appeared.
//
// # What this package is
//
// A retrospective policy evaluator. Given a policy P and a time window
// over stored flows, it answers: which observed flows would P have
// denied, which workloads would have lost which dependencies, and when
// did each affected pattern first appear. The output is a Receipt: a
// signed, timestamped artifact that can be attached to a change request
// or a postmortem.
//
// # What this package is not
//
// It is not a policy engine — it does not enforce anything and does not
// touch the datapath. Its only input is stored Flow records and a Policy
// description; its only output is a report. It is not a simulator either:
// it evaluates flows as atomic records (was this observed flow allowed or
// denied), not TCP state or timing. This is a deliberate simplification,
// disclosed in every receipt.
//
// # Where flows come from
//
// This package defines its own narrow Store interface and ships an
// in-memory reference implementation (MemoryStore). It does not assume
// any particular flow-history backend. As of this writing, Netra itself
// has no queryable historical per-flow store — every existing
// observability feature works off live/recent AgentReport aggregates
// (internal/health, internal/pathdiag, internal/dropdiag, ...), not
// individually retained flow records. Wiring a production Store
// implementation (backed by whatever retention mechanism Netra adopts)
// is a separate, larger piece of work than this package itself.
