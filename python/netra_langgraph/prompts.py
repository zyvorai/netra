"""Prompts used when an OpenAI-compatible key is configured.

The controller already rewrites briefs when NETRA_AI_API_KEY is set on
netrad. These prompts are for the *companion* process only, when the
operator wants LangGraph to do a second-pass synthesis over multiple
tool results. They repeat Netra's safety contract.
