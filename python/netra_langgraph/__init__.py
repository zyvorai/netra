"""Optional LangGraph companion for Netra natural-language triage.

This package is a *separate process* from `netrad`. The controller stays
stdlib-only (see AGENTS.md). The graph talks to existing `/api/v1/ai/*`
and specialist observability endpoints over HTTP with the same bearer
token as `netractl`.

It never applies rules, never flips enforce mode, and never asks for
payloads, argv, or Secret contents.
